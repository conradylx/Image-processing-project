This project aims to implement certain image processing algorithms. Part 1/8 implements the design of two forms in which the image is downloaded from the disk and a histogram for the RGB image channels is generated. Updates every week.

The project is created as part of passing laboratories at the university.
### Tech

Project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [#C] - Back-end language
* [.NET WinForms] - GUI
* [emgucv] - .NET library,

### Installation

To run the project please go to APO_16035\APO_16035\bin\Debug then launch APO_16035.exe file.

### Actually progress
1) Designed graphic user interface.
2) Functions responsible for displaying the image and calculating the histogram have been created.

### Todos (at the moment)

1) Implement image negation
2) Image histogram stretching
3) Image histogram alignment
4) Thresholding.
